    2020 NBA SEASON- LOVE IT OR HATE IT, ONE QUITE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS
The 2020 NBA season had high expectations especially following the events from the previous season with the Toronto Raptors making history by winning their first ever NBA Championship by beating the modern era ‘super team’ of the NBA- the Golden State Warriors.
 I’m sure by now we know the 2020 NBA Champions- L.A. LAKERS. Want the season recap? Well, have at it. Just a few minutes read. So many exciting things happened and my mind feels cheated not dishing out everything since I have to keep it short. Where to start from... Oh yeah. FREE AGENCY!!

2019 Free Agency
Free agency season has and will always be an exciting period for fans of the NBA, as it determines the new power structure for the upcoming season. But this particular year’s was extra. Within 6 hours of free agency officially starting, we already had a fair idea what that could look like. Anthony Davis, the All Star forward was signed by the L.A. Lakers from the New Orleans Pelicans, who drafted Zion Williamson with their first pick. A LeBron-Davis partnership. Sweet!-Well at least for Lakers fans.
As if the injuries to their star players that caused them the title in the finals was not enough, the GSW’s Kevin Durant became a free agent and was heading to New York. A move that ended at the Brooklyn Nets (to the disappointment of their 20 minutes-drive city rivals who wanted him) to join Kyrie Irving, who joined from the Boston Celtics. The Celtics, however landed Kemba Walker and the Warriors got D’Angelo Russell in a tradeoff deal with Durant. All Star, Russell Westbrook opted for free agency that saw him reunited with James Harden at the Houston Rockets and Chris Paul joining the Oklahoma City Thunders in an exchange deal. Miami Heat acquired Jimmy Butler in what proved to an important deal for them at the end of the season.
After all these, the biggest of them was yet to come. Where was Kawhi Leonard going after he declared free agency? It took us 6 whole days to finally get an answer. 6 days of speculations, rumours and even chopper stalking the 2019 NBA Finals MVP’s movement. And then the L.A. Clippers was confirmed as the chosen destination after they managed to bring in Paul George as the other piece.
And just like that, the power structure moved from the Bay Area in San Francisco to Los Angeles along with conversation as to who the city belongs to and rules the Western Conference- LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard. I guess we have our answer now. In summary, the agency season saw over US$4 billion exchanging hands.



The Season Itself
The 74th season of the NBA was one quite like none other. With twists, difficult and sad moments off the court and at the same time, fun and exciting on it. The season had it first blow in January with the killing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna along with other passengers in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California- shaking the basketball, and indeed the sports world to the core. The NBA later organized the season’s All Star Games in his honour.
And then the biggest disruption in the year, the COVID 19 pandemic hit the NBA like every other thing we love and enjoy. The league came to a hiatus after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus in March. It was not until July 31st that the season resumed in a bubble format designed by the board. That which saw only 22 best performed teams from both conferences making it to the bubble held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports at the Disney Resort. Even this 8 game event before the playoffs had to pause for a break in protest against the killing of George Floyd and racism by the players.
Aside these setbacks, it was season very much excellent in every other regard. After all the talking and expectations during the offseason, it was time to deliver on them. 
Eastern Conference: 
All eyes were on the Toronto Raptors, the defending champions. After losing Kawhi Leonard, it was interesting to see how they would cope without him. Turns out they still are a brilliant team without him, despite suffering a number of injuries as well. They finished second to the Milwaukee Bucks, a team that dominated the conference and indeed had the best record in the entire league- winning 56 games and losing only 17. The conference had, in addition to the above two teams, the  Bolton Celtics(3rd), Indiana Pacers(4th), Miami Heat(5th) Philadelphia 76ers(6th), Brooklyn Nets(7th) and Orlando Magic(8th) making it to the playoffs. The conference was eventually won by the Miami Heats after beating their fierce rivals, Boston Celtics 4-2 in the finals.
    Key Players: Perhaps the very first player to come to mind will be Giannis Antetokounmpo whose excellent performance for the Bucks earned him a back to back MVP award along with the Defensive Player of the year award. He averaged 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists. Jimmy Butler made sure to turn on the heat for the Miami Heat leading them to the conference and championship Finals. Kemba Walker also paired with Jayson Tatum to give the Celtics a worthwhile season.
Western Conference: 
The teams to watch were the two from L.A. - Lakers and Clippers. And of course they delivered in the final skim of things and finished first and second seed respectively. The Rockets and Nuggets were sure to make their presence felt. However, many, including myself knew it was going to be a difficult season for the bay area boys- Warriors. But never thought it could be as badly as it turned out for them. They finished bottom on the conference table. And for the first time in about 5 years, we could not predict at least one team that will make it to the finals. The Lakers won the conference finals 4-1 against the Denver Nuggets, who got there by making two historic 3-1 comebacks against the Utah Jazz and ‘surprise surprise’, the L.A. Clippers.
   Key Players: LeBron James after missing out on the playoffs during his first season at the Lakers redeemed himself and qualified the franchise through to the playoffs and to the finals for the first time in a decade with the help of his new teammate, Anthony Davis. 
James Harden pulled an average points of 34.3 per game in the season for the Rockets. Luka Doncic, the former Real Madrid baller and previous year’s rookie of the year winner continued his rise to elite status- proving to be the talisman for the Mavericks. Of course this list cannot go out with a Damian Lillard mention and how he came to life for the Trail Blazers and qualifying them to the playoffs. The conference also witnessed some rookie brilliance of Zion Williamson of the Pelicans and Ja Morant of the Grizzlies, who was voted the Rookie of the year.

Championship Finals
And so after all that needed to be proven in the regular season and conference playoffs, the L.A. Lakers and Miami Heat were on top to battle it for the 2 feet tall, sterling silver and vermeil with 24 karat gold overlaid trophy and the bragging right that comes with it. In what seemed like it was going to be an easy run for the Lakers by game 2, the Heat managed to stretch the finals to game 6 with 2 wins. The Lakers secured their 17th NBA title with a 4-2 win over the Miami Heat - equaling the Boston Celtics’ record for most titles.

Now What?
Now we patiently wait for the start of next season in January 2021. But before then, conversations have once again began- as to who the greatest player of all time is, now that LeBron James has won 4 titles with 3 different teams along with all his incredible stats in the game, or whether Michael Jordan still remains the GOAT in the history of the game.
Also, Are the Golden State Warriors likely to bounce back to their very best or is their dynasty now over.
Which star players will be traded when Agency season starts and the possible implications it would have for the various teams in the NBA.  We can only wait.
